# Make sure there is no space between the = and your callsign.

# Receive Frequency (Hz)
# The normal receive frequency used by Project Horus is 443.5 MHz
RXFREQ=443500000

# SDR Type. Set this to RTLSDR for RTL-SDR use or KA9Q for KA9Q-Radio use
SDR_TYPE=RTLSDR

# RTLSDR Device ID. Leave this at 0 if you don't want to use a particular device
DEVICE=0

# Receiver Gain (RTL-SDR only). Set this to 0 to use automatic gain control, otherwise if running a
# preamplifier, you may want to experiment with lower gain settings to optimize
# your receiver setup.
# You can find what gain range is valid for your RTLSDR by running: rtl_test
# A very rough figure that may work if you are running a preamp with ~20 dB gain is
# 32.8 - your performance may vary!
GAIN=0

# Bias Tee Enable (1) or Disable (0) (RTL-SDR only)
# Enable this is you are intending on powering a preamplifer via coax from your RTLSDR
BIAS=0


# Baud Rate & FSK Demod Oversampling Settings
#
# Default: 115177 baud 8x oversampling (Default using a RPi Zero W's UART)
# Other parameters which *may* work, but are un-tested:
# 9600 baud, 100x oversampling
# 4800 baud, 200x oversampling
#
BAUD_RATE=115177

# UDP Payload Summary
# Default: 0 (disabled)
# Set this to a valid UDP port (55673 typically) to emit payload summary packets for use
# with Chasemapper
UDP_PORT=0

# UDP Port used for Wenet inter-process communication.
# If you are intenting on running more than one Wenet instance on the same computer
# (e.g. multiple docker containers), use a different port for each instance.
